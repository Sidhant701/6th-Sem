'''7. Write a Python program to simulate a card game using object-oriented principles. The program should
include a Card class to represent individual playing cards, a Deck class to represent a deck of cards,
and a Player class to represent players receiving cards. Implement a shuffle method in the Deck class
to shuffle the cards and a deal method to distribute cards to players. Display each playerâ€™s hand after
dealing.'''
