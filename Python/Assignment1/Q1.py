'''1. What is the significance of classes in Python programming, and how do they contribute to object-oriented programming?'''

'''
Ans:-
Significance of classes in Python programming:
    1. They are the building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
    2. Allow us to create objects with properties and behaviors.
    3. Serve as templates for creating objects, which are instances of a class.
    4. Help us model real-world entities in our code.
    5. Organize our code, improve reusability, and maintainability.

Contribution to object-oriented programming:
    1. Encapsulation: Classes allow us to encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit.
    2. Inheritance: Classes support inheritance, allowing us to create new classes based on existing ones.
    3. Polymorphism: Classes enable polymorphism, allowing us to use objects of different classes interchangeably.
    4. Abstraction: Classes help us abstract away complex details, making it easier to work with complex systems.
